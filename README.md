## Python Functionality Implemented
* Nested lists, dictionaries and loops
* Match:case statements
* Output print formatting and string calculations
* List comprehension with sum() function

* The menu.py file wihtin the python-challenge-1 repo was created using Python version 3.10.14. To run it, please download the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), as well as a code editor that runs Python ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac), etc.).
* Copy the file link from GitHub (Click the Code dropdown button and copy the HTTPS URL to clipboard)
* Clone the file from GitHub into the desired folder on your computer (type: "git clone <link to file>" and press enter)
## Run Instructions:
In Terminal (Mac) or GitBash (Windows):
* Ensure that you're running the correct version of Python (see Set Up above)

* The program will output a receipt with the calculated order total 
## References
* The menu.py starter file was downloaded from the AI-PT-WEST-MAY-052824_MTTH Module 2 Challenge files and edited to create the menu ordering system
* From the AI-PT-WEST-MAY-052824_MTTH, the Module 2 Challenge match_case_solution.py code was leveraged to build a match:case statement checking for whether the customer wants to keep ordering.
